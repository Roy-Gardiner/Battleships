Battleships. 

This was a first group project at the academy. 

The aim was to make a working version of the traditional game Battleships. 

We used TDD with Rspec and Ruby, and pair programmed in groups of four to achieve the results. 

The biggest challenge was to make sure ships did not go off the board when being placed!
